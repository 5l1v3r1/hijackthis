Hi, I am Polshyn Stanislav from Ukraine. And I glad to present you a continuation of Trend Micro HiJackThis development.

## Overview

HiJackThis Fork is a free utility for Microsoft Windows that generates a report of non-standard parameters of registry and file system for selectively removal of items related to the activities of malware, adware and security risks.

HJT primarily rely on hijacking methods rather than a database, that's why it makes no separation between safe and unsafe items, giving you the ability to selectively remove items from your machine.

## Features

 * Lists the contents of key areas of the registry and hard drive
 * Generate reports and presents them in an organized fashion
 * Does not target specific programs and URLs
 * Detects only the methods used by hijackers to force you onto their sites
 * The possibility of adding to autostart scanning at system boot (//TODO)
 * No need constant updates

## New on version 3

 * Detecting several new hijacking methods
 * Full support of new OS
 * New and updated supplement tools
 * Improved interface
 * More securely

Also HiJackThis comes with several tools useful in manually removing malware from a computer:
 * StartupList 2 (*new*)
 * Process Manager
 * Uninstall manager
 * Hosts file manager
 * Alternative Data Spy
 * Delete file / service staff
 * Digital Signature Checker (*new*)
 * Registry key unlocker (*new*)

## Log analysis

IMPORTANT: HiJackThis does not make value based calls between what is considered good or bad.
It is important to exercise caution and avoid making changes to your computer settings, unless you have expert knowledge.
