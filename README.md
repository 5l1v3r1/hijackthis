Hi, I am Polshyn Stanislav from Ukraine. I am happy to present a continuation of Trend Micro HiJackThis development.

## Overview

HiJackThis Fork is a free utility for Microsoft Windows.  It identifies non-standard registry and file system parameters.  You can selectively remove these items as they relate to malware, adware, and other security risks.

HiJackThis Fork primarily detects **hijacking methods** rather than comparing items against a pre-built database.  This allows it to detect new or previously unknown malware - but it also makes **no distinction** between safe and unsafe items.  Users are expected to research all scanned items, and only remove items from their PC when absolutely appropriate.
