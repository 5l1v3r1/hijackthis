Hi, I am Polshyn Stanislav from Ukraine. And I glad to present you a continuation of Trend Micro HiJackThis development.

## Overview

HiJackThis Fork is a free utility for Microsoft Windows that generates a report of non-standard parameters of registry and file system for selectively removal of items related to the activities of malware, adware and security risks.

HJT primarily rely on hijacking methods rather than a database, that's why it makes no separation between safe and unsafe items, giving you the ability to selectively remove items from your machine.

## Features

 * Lists the contents of key areas of the Registry and hard drive
 * Generate reports and presents them in an organized fashion
 * Does not target specific programs and URLs
 * Detects only the methods used by hijackers to force you onto their sites
 * The possibility of adding to autostart scanning at system boot (TODO)
 * No need constant updates

## New on version 3

 * Detecting several new hijacking methods
 * Full support of new OS
 * New and updated supplement tools
 * Improved interface
 * More securely

Also HiJackThis comes with several tools useful in manually removing malware from a computer:
 * (updated) StartupList 2 
 * (updated) Process Manager
 * (updated) Uninstall manager
 * (updated) Hosts file manager
 * (updated) Alternative Data Spy
 * (updated) Delete file / service staff
 * (new) Digital Signature Checker
 * (new) Registry key unlocker
