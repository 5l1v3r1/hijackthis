Hi, I am Polshyn Stanislav from Ukraine. And I glad to present you a continuation of Trend Micro HiJackThis development.

## Overview

HiJackThis Fork is a free utility for Microsoft Windows that generates a report of non-standard parameters of registry and file system for selectively removal of items related to the activities of malware, adware and security risks.

HJT primarily rely on hijacking methods rather than a database, that's why it makes no separation between safe and unsafe items, giving you the ability to selectively remove items from your machine.
